We are eager to show our project on the problem statement – 

An AI-powered quiz generator helps teachers create tailored quizzes instantly by selecting topics, difficulty levels, and question counts. This tool enhances efficiency, ensuring high-quality assessments while saving valuable time. With automated question generation and answer keys, educators can focus more on teaching and student engagement rather than manual quiz preparation.
